          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Fuel4School is a movement born from our concerns about subpar school lunches. We‚Äôre passionate about food justice and health, working to create meal options that all students can enjoy and benefit from.</p>
          <p>Did you know that the DOE School Lunch budget is 600 million? That might seem like a lot at first, but when the entire DOE budget is 40 billion the food budget only accounts for 1.5 percent. In addition to that the DOE has faced many budget cuts to its food program resulting in the removal of many pricier and student favorite items from their menus such as chicken tenders and dumplings.</p>
          <p>In addition, NYC public schools generate 80 million pounds of trash of which 47 percent is food waste. A lot of kids are just not enjoying the lunches and just throwing everything away. Although food composting programs have rolled out in NYC schools a lot of food just does not get recycled properly.</p>
          <p>Get involved! Share your thoughts via our survey or reach out to collaborate. Together, we can improve school nutrition.</p>
