# Fuel4School 

**Fuel4School** is a student-led campaign dedicated to improving public school lunches across the city. We are advocating for healthier and more diverse school lunch options.

## Purpose

Many students rely on school meals as a primary source of nutrition. Unfortunately, our current lunch programs offered in NYC schools lack both quality and variety. 

- Repersent student opinions with surveys and data. 
- Advocate for improvements in meal quality.
- Collaborate with students, educators, and community leaders to design a better lunch menu. 

## Features

- Student opinion system (HTML/JS using surveys) 
- Interactive data visualizations (coming soon)


## Built With

- HTML5 & CSS3
- GitHub Pages for deployment
- JavaScript (planned for surveys and interactivity)
